# Redbase
My attempt to create a simple relational database management system from scratch,
following stanford's cs346. Since I do not have access to the pre-coded interfaces that students in stanford taking the course get, I am writing those too. I am writing this whole project in haskell for fun(yes, the page file management system included. It is fun). The most up-to-date state of this code is on a private repo on bitbucket. This project is a hobby of mine as I work on my dissertation. I welcome advise and suggestions.
